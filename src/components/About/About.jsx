        Our website offers two main pathways for your travel planning. You can
        choose to explore specific travel destinations by selecting the country
        and city you're interested in. Once you make your selection, you'll be
        redirected to our Explore page where you can read detailed information
        about the city and select further objectives if available. From here,
        you can directly choose your accommodation options, or add the city and
        its objectives to your Itinerary for later review. The Itinerary tab
        allows you to visualize your selections as cards, making it easy to
        organize and finalize your travel plans. You can then opt for
        accommodation, with choices ranging from low to high budget based on
        your selections.{" "}

        Alternatively, if you prefer ready-made travel options, you can select a
        country from the homepage and be redirected to a page where you can
        choose between cities or regions. You'll then select your travel
        period—3, 5, or 7 days—and your budget preference. These selections can
        be saved to the Choices tab, where you can easily visualize or delete
        them as needed.{" "}
